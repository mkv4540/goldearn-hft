# GoldEarn HFT - Deployment & Infrastructure

## ðŸš€ **Deployment Overview**

### **Infrastructure Strategy**
- **Development**: Local Docker environment
- **Testing**: Cloud-based testing infrastructure
- **Production**: NSE co-location + cloud hybrid

### **Deployment Architecture**

```yaml
environments:
  development:
    platform: "Docker Compose"
    resources: "Local machine"
    
  testing:
    platform: "AWS EKS"
    region: "ap-south-1 (Mumbai)"
    
  production:
    platform: "Bare metal + AWS"
    locations: 
      - "NSE co-location (Mahape)"
      - "AWS Mumbai region"
```

## ðŸ”§ **Infrastructure Requirements**

### **Co-location Setup**
- **NSE Data Center**: Sub-millisecond connectivity
- **Hardware**: High-performance servers with FPGA
- **Networking**: Dedicated fiber connections

### **Cloud Infrastructure**
- **Compute**: EC2 instances for non-latency-critical services
- **Storage**: S3 for data archival, EBS for databases
